**Acupuncturists** in New Mexico are required to have at least 2,400
hours of graduate level education. This includes 900 hours of
supervised clinical practice. In addition, each acupuncturist in New
Mexico must pass a national certification exam from the [National
Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental
Medicine (NCCAOM)](https://www.nccaom.org/).

The education also includes over 400 hours of modern allopathic, or
biomedicine. This allows **acupuncturists** to provide true *primary
care* by integrating modern science and traditional wisdom. In
addition to acupuncture, acupuncturists often prescribe herbal
formulas according to *Traditional Chinese Medicine* that have been
tested over time and refined to nourish the health of modern
patients.
