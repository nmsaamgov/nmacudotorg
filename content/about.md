**Acupuncture** can be defined as: *The surgical procedure of
inserting solid filiform needles into the body in a therapeutic
context.* Acupuncture needles are single use, and are sterilized by
the manufacturer prior to being distributed to acupuncturists. The
acupuncture needle, also called a *filiform needle* is a medical
device regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the
United States. 

The *Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine Practice Act* was passed in
1978 in the State of New Mexico and has been updated through the years
to reflect the evolving state of medicine. It defines *the practice of oriental 
medicine* as:

> a distinct system of primary health care with the goal of
> prevention, cure, or correction of any disease, illness, injury,
> pain or other physical or mental condition by controlling and
> regulating the flow and balance of energy, form and function to
> restore and maintain health.
