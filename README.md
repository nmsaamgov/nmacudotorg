# New Mexico Acupuncture

These are the development files / content for the website at
[NewMexicoAcupuncture.org](https://newmexicoacupuncture.org/) 

The site was developed with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and uses the
*Soho* theme. 

## Replicating the Site

The files can be replicated with the standard incantation:

`git clone git@github.com:nmsaamgov/nmacudotorg.git`

And then the HTML/CSS can be generated with the standard Hugo command
(assuming hugo is installed, of course). 

`hugo`

from the root directory. This will create the directory *public* and
place HTML/CSS files and resources (eg images) in it. This directory
is then suitable for upload via FTP/SSH to any standard web host. 

## NMSAAM

Mexico Society for Acupuncture and Asian Medicine (NMSAAM)**
